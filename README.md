Direwolf GUIs and scripts for Nexus DR-X

## TNC Manager

This app allows you configure and monitor the ARDOP TNC (piardopc), Direwolf TNC and pat, the Winlink client app. It replaces the now deprecated __Direwolf TNC and pat GUI__.  It cannot be run while either the __Direwolf TNC and pat GUI__ or the __Direwolf APRS GUI__ is running.

__IMPORTANT:__ A kernel bug may prevent consecutive AX25 connections to another packet station. [Description and workaround.](https://github.com/NexusDR-X/nexus-bootstrap/wiki/7.-Bugs-and-Annoyances#kernel-bug-prevents-consecutive-ax25-connections)

## Direwolf TNC and pat GUI

__DEPRECATED__. Use the __TNC Manager__ app instead.

## Direwolf APRS GUI

Allows you to configure and monitor Direwolf as an APRS node in various modes. It cannot be run while either the __Direwolf TNC and pat GUI__ or the __TNC Manager__ is running.
